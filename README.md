# Prime Breathing Simulation  
  
A PyTorch-based simulation that visualizes breathing patterns based on prime numbers and prime gaps.  
  
## Description  
  
This project simulates a breathing mechanism where:  
- Entities "breathe in" when encountering prime numbers  
- Entities "breathe out" during gaps between primes  
- Visualization shows survival patterns in a 2D tensor representation  
  
## Performance  
  
- 100x100 tensor simulation runs in approximately 30 seconds on CPU  
  
## Requirements  
  
- PyTorch  
- OpenCV (cv2)  
- SymPy  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
  
## Usage  
  
```python  
python BreatheIfPrime.py  
``` 
  
## Installation  
  
Install the required dependencies:  
  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```
